# Linux-chr_dev_driver-cslab
Linux character device driver assignement for NTUA CSlab 2017-2018.

A lot of code provided by course instructor (Vangelis Koukis) as a skeleton. Each file refers explicitly its author.

The aim of this assignement was to implement a character device driver for Linux. More specifiacally we receive raw data from a system of sensors (light-batt-temp) and provide them to the user space via special files-endpoints that we create under /dev directory.

lunix-tng file: contains all the code for the driver.

utopia file: set up and launch Qemu Vm.

report file: contains the report of assignement (in Greek).
